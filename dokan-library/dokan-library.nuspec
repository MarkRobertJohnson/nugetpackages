        <description>User mode file system for windows, FUSE for windows.
When you want to create a new file system on Windows, for example to
improve FAT or NTFS, you need to develope a file system
driver. Developing a device driver that works in kernel mode on
windows is extremley difficult.By using Dokan library, you can create
your own file systems very easily without writing device driver. Dokan
Library is similar to FUSE(Linux user mode file system) but works on
Windows.
Note: Installer doesn’t work silently if Dokan Library is already installed. The uninstaller also doesn’t work silently.</description>
